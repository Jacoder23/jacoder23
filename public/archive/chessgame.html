        <h3>A Chess Game On A Cloudy Day(463 words)</h3>
        &emsp;&emsp;"E5, your move." The man across me said.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"I know," I replied with a smile, "F4. Your move."

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"Hmm." He pondered for a moment. "A difficult opening. To use and to play that is."

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;The man bent over the table looking at me.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"You sure you don't want to take that back?"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;The clouds disappeared, the table and chairs were gone. The only things left were me and the old man.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"You sure you don't want to take that back?"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"I don't know what you're talking about. What are you doing?" I asked.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"You sure you don't want to take that back?"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;But I knew exactly what he was saying.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"You sure you don't want to take that back?"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;I could never forget those words.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"You sure you don't want to take that back?"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;His last words.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;-----

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"See you tomorrow!" I call after my new friend before she leaves. "Don't forget the 10 dollars you owe!"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"Oh shut it!" She calls back playfully as she walks back to her house.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;I smile as I walk home from school knowing that I'd get to play with her again.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;As I enter my house I greet my mom and tell her about my day.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"I told you so!" She cheerfully tells me, "Moving isn't the end of the world!"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"She did tell me I'd get new friends didn't she." I think to myself silently while pouting.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;The two of us finish up the day and go to sleep together.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;-----

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"E5, your move." The man across me said. What?

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"I know," I replied with a smile, "F4. Your move." Why did I smile? Why did I say that?

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"Hmm." He pondered for a moment. "A difficult opening. To use and to play that is." No. Oh no.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;The man bent over the table looking at me.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"You sure you don't want to take that back?"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;The same words again.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"You sure you don't want to take that back?"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;He loved bluffing me with that. Telling me to take back my move.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"You sure you don't want to take that back?"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;I love it, even if I hated it at the time.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;-----

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;I wake up. My ears are ringing.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"You sure you don't want to take that back?"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;I see the man. My father.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"You sure you don't want to take that back?"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;He's holding a gun to my head. Mom isn't here.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;Dad left us long ago. Mom discovered that he did some pretty bad things before. And he kept doing it.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"Tell me."

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;I didn't believe it. I couldn't believe it.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"Please."

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;I tried to bring him back with us, to get him to stay.

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"Don't leave. I'll always follow you."

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;And he told me:

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;"You sure you don't want to take that back?"

        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;Gunshot.
