Gonna upgrade to a R7 250x.

How the hell do you get inside Primm!!??

I can't tell you how many hours I wasted on Saliva Island.

I play Expendabros like Hitman.

Civilization V.

I remember playing Budokai Tenkaichi : Another Road on my PSP. X! Double X! Pressing O 9000 times! That was pretty much the entire game for me.

I learned programming to make mods for Plants vs Zombies.
Bookworm Adventures 2 was way too easy. It was the tinge of loneliness in the original that made it for me.

I actually liked Spore. Except, for the entire game. The first stage and the Creature Creator were pretty fun though.

Trackpad Input Master Race.

You'd think a programmer would use a mechanical keyboard.

You'd think someone for types thing all day would be somewhat fast at it.

You know, I wonder why there were so few good virus generators. I guess that's why  I made a worse one. Though the newest version a lot better. Only a few options though.

Hey, could you do me a favor and send me an idea or two for new projects? The Neocities button in the submenu lets you comment on my website. Too bad you have to sign up for a free website and massive amounts of bandwidth with it.

I really need some money for this site. I'm getting scared that if it expand the site even more I might run out of monthly bandwidth.

...

I should get going.

There's things to be done, homework to be finished.

*sigh*

...

You should get going too.

After all, most of these projects were built on simple ideas.

And fortunately, I know you have a ton of them, hidden but not gone.

Silent, but not mute.

Simple. But still kickass.

So turn those kickass ideas into something that doesn't just kickass your ass but kicks my mine too.

Sorry! You're gonna have to figure that one on your own. Good luck!
