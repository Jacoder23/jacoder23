		<p>So I've been thinking, what if you could make a mobile game in Scratch? There have been a few attempts at porting the Scratch engine to other platforms by fans so, I decided to go with an HTML5 based engine named Sulfurous.</p>
		<p>I didn't want to use just any game to test out so I took <a id="link" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/85107020/">Griffpatch's 3D City Game</a> and gave it on-screen buttons.</p>
		<p>The resulting mess can be seen down below (it's using the Sulfurous Engine which has a few performance issues and a few odd glitches). Try not to go into fullscreen as that causes all sorts of performance issues.</p>
