	<h3>What is a Zine?</h3>
	
	<p>Zine is short for magazine but especially refers to independently published work often self-made by marginalized communities.</p>

	<p>In recent decades, they've become less beholden to the traditional print format and e-zines or electronic zines have emerged.</p>

	<p>Recently, experimentation in the medium has become popular. E-zines often have multimedia elements such as video and audio or are even interactive.</p>

	<h4>Filipino Social Media Culture</h4>
	
	<p>After all, we're 2nd in the world in terms of time spent daily on the internet on average at <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1589845/social-media-internet-craze-keep-ph-on-top-2-of-world-list">10 hours, 27 minutes</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Given our feeds are dictated by algorithms and machine learning, it can be questioned if we are practicing full agency when we browse social media.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, our politicians <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_972Y8iwrX8">employ trolls on social media</a> to control discourse.</p>
	
	
	
		
	<h4>Which fragments of the Summa Theologica?</h4>
	<p>One <a href="https://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP083.html#FPQ83OUTP1">specific example would be Question 83 on the topic of Free Will.</a> </p>
